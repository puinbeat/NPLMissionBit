                When you get to Mission, you immediately recognize the big building.
            </p>
            <p>
                It takes you sometime to do the sign-in thing at the front desk and to look for the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                You enter the interview room and are surprised to see the interviewer is the buinessman with the briefcase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without any hesitation, the interviewer comes near you to say thank you that he didn't have a chance to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, the man is willing to employ you without interviewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It really is <a href="easterEgg.html"> fate </a> that I woke up late today" - You thought with a smile on your face.
