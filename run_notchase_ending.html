                After waiting a little bit, you are surprised to see that the interviewer you're waiting for is actually the businessman you saw earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                He looks very angry and tells you to go home because he's lost all your files.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have no choice but to go home.
            </p>
            <p>
                You were rejected before even interviewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You wonder how things would turn out if you help him getting his briefcase back.
