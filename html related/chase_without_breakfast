                You run after the man.
            </p>
            <p>
                With your athletic nature, it isn't difficult for you to catch up the gangster.
            </p>
            <p>
                You manage to take back the briefcase but you can't hold the man.
            </p>
            <p>
                You let the man run away because you need to hand the briefcase back to its owner and you're really late for the interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                You give the businessman his briefcase and hurry on your way without even waiting for him to thank you.
