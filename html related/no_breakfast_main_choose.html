            There are three ways that you can go to the interview place.
        </p>
        <p>
            First is to call a taxi, which is the most convenient way. However, you still need to consider the time it takes for the taxi to come to your house.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second way is taking a bus. It is a considerable way because you know the bus schedule and the buses are always on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last option is to run as fast as you can, hoping you will make it on time.
