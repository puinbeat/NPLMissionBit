                When you get to the room, the interviewer tells you to go home because his briefcase was taken by a stranger this morning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the briefcase was your profiles.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have no choice but to go home.
            </p>
            <p>
                You were rejected before even interviewing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You wonder how things would turn out if you chose another way.
