            <p>
                You get on a bus.
            </p>
            <p>
                After awhile, you suddenly realize that you don't know how to get to the building.
            </p>
            <p>
                You vaguely remember that a friend told you the building was on Mission street.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you looked it up last week and got a feeling that it's on Harrison street.
            </p>
            <p>
                You know that in order to get to Harrison, you need to change bus route which would probably take a few minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you go to Mission, just stay on this bus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which way would you go?
            </p>
