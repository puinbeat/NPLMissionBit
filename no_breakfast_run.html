                You decide to run.

                Unfortunately, you can hardly remember the address. You vaguely remember that a friend told you the building was on Mission street.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you looked it up last week and got a feeling that it's on Harrison street.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which way would you choose?
